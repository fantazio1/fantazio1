## Welcome!

I'm a frontend engineer who focuses in performance, accessibility, clean looks and always follow best practices.

While I have professional experience with TypeScript, React and Redux, I diversify my skillset and expand my horizons by constantly exploring new technologies and tools!
I believe that curiosity and dedication in constant learning are necessary requirements for great software engineers.
